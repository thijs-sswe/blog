Hi I'm Thijs and I'm a technical consultant for a managed security services provider. My daily activities are centered around Microsoft Security products and services, however I am more of a GNU/Linux guy. I have experience building software in Python and Go, and frequently find myself condemning PowerShell scripts and ARM templates.

Why another blog I hear you thinking? No, I'm not trying to become a Microsoft MVP. It's just too many times that I find myself missing a specific piece of information on the web. Or if I find it, it's targeted to PowerShell fanatics. Which I am not. 

So, the content you're going to see here is stuff that I would like to read myself. I'll be sharing practicle information on software engineering and automation in a cyber security context. I'll also be publishing ideas and contemplations that are more business oriented, or just stuff to clear my mind. The topics will be chosen based on my own interests or things that are happening in my day-to-day work.
