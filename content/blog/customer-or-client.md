# Customer or Client?
While working with pipelines and scripts, I encounter the words 'Client' and 'Customer' frequently and see them being used interchangeably. 

Since I am a proponent of using a [ubiquitus language](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/UbiquitousLanguage.html), I'm wondering if one can use the terms interchangeably and if not, which term should be used when? 

So let's start by looking at their definitions.

> [Customer](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/customer), a person who buys goods or a service


> [Client](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/client), a customer or someone who receives services

Interestingly enough the definition mentions "a customer".
